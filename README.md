This repository is a part of my second semester course BİL102 (software engineering fundamentals) assingment given by Professor Deniz KILINÇ.
The assingment is to write an article about SDLC models in Turkish language and share it on medium.com as well as on github.

The subjects that i touched in my article are: What are SDLC models?; Why are SDLC models used?; What are the fundamental SDLC phases?; What are some SDLC models?; Comparison of models


What are SDLC models? : In a nutshell SDLC models are used as a plan for certain softwares development.


Why are SDLC models used? : Since 1960's SDLC models were used for a couple of reasons. One, these models make it easy-to-understand for the client. Two, it makes it easy for the software engineering team to program. etc.


What are fundamental SDLC phases? : Requirements phase, clients needs and wishes are gathered. Analysis phase, requirements are analized. Design phase, modules and stuff like data bases as well as algorithms are designed. Implementation phase, coding is done in this phase. Post-delivery phase, bug fixes and adding new features.


What are some SDLC models? :

Haphazard model; no planning, generally one person and easy project, is not used at professional spaces any more.

Barok model; fundamental SDLC phases are done once in a linner fashion, more than one person can work on a project, is not used at professional spaces any more.

Waterfall model; a.k.a. the traditional model, every fundamental SDLC phase is at least repeated once, most time is spent on requirements and analysis phases.

V model; testing starts after all coding is done, last coded gets first tested.

Spiral model; software is coded in a iterative incremental way, every loop represents a phase.

Incremental development model; a barebone program is released early and every new update is a big patch, like Cyberpunk 2077.


Comparison of models :

Haphazard model; cant't do big or complicated projects, bad for team projects, no documentation currently is good for one person hobby projects.

Barok model; more organized compared to haphazard model, 'how to repeat past steps' isn't clear, documentation is another phase after implementation.

Waterfall model; documentation is made at the same time, is not flexible, is good for mid-low sized projects with certain requirements.

Spiral model; has strong documentation, can create an early prototype, is more costly compared to other models, is good for high-risk projects.

Incremental development model; can create a prototype earlier than spiral model, is more flexible than other models, more costly tha waterfall model, is good for rushing a product to market early (like Cyberpunk 2077).
